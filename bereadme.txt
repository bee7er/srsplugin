C4D Plugin Development

The executaable plugin is defined in a *.pyp file, i.e. a Python Plugin

To get them installed:

	Write the plugin.  I have been writing them in my Code folder, so that I can use GIT repository

	Hit the Edit menu option and at the bottom Open Preferences Folder
	
	Paste the folder into the plugins folder
	
	Exit and reload C4D
